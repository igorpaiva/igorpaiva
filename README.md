## Hi there! 👋

I'm [Igor Araujo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igor-paiva-araujo/), a software developer passionate about creating high-quality, scalable solutions that power everything from low-level firmware to sleek web applications. Whether it’s diving deep into hardware integration or building APIs that just work, I love tackling challenges and making tech more awesome.

### 👨‍💻 A Bit About Me
- 📚 **Academic background**: I am an Electrical Engineer, graduated from [UFCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Campina_Grande)!
- 🌍 **Where I’ve Worked**: Over the past 3 years, I’ve delivered projects for local (Brazil) and international clients like HP Inc., collaborating with teams across the Americas while working on [VIRTUS-UFCG](https://www.virtus.ufcg.edu.br/en/).
- 🔄 **What I Do**: From writing REST APIs to working with industrial communication protocols (think Modbus, OPC-UA, MQTT), I’m all about making systems talk to each other smoothly.
- 📦 Tools of the Trade:
  - **Backend**: Spring Boot, [Ulfius](https://github.com/babelouest/ulfius)
  - **Frontend Collabs**: Angular, React
  - **Embedded**: Firmware for network devices (embedded REST APIs)
  - **DevOps**: Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Git
  - **Programming languages**: Java, C/C++, Python, TypeScript, and others... Try me! 😁
- 🛠 **How I Work**: Agile methodologies, containerized environments, and lots of unit testing.
### 🚀 What I’ve Built Professionally
- 📸 **Digital Camera Software**: Developed Python-based solutions for hardware integration.
- 💾 **PC Hardware DLLs**: Built C++ libraries to extract and process hardware information.
- 🕹 **Firmware & Embedded Solutions**: Optimized network device functionality using industrial-grade protocols.
- 🌐 **Web Apps**: Delivered RESTful APIs and dynamic interfaces for consumer electronics.
### 👀 **What will you find on my GitHub?**
I'm trying to showcase the maximum number of languages/technologies that I've worked with over the years. I am currently focusing on **Web Development** (back and front-end) and **C/C++ development** (mainly emulators). I plan on creating more Python apps and embedded projects in a near future.
### 🌟 Fun Stuff About Me
- I’m all about learning new things and overcoming challenges (seriously, sometimes I can't even sleep thinking about a bug or something I couldn't fix 😅. But when I succeed, the feeling is the best).
- I enjoy collaborating with teams—whether it’s brainstorming solutions or refining code over coffee (and talking about tech over beer 🤫).
- I love teaching the stuff I know to other people!
